        <section class="introduction">
            <p class="p1">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, better known as SpaceX, is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California, USA. It was founded in 2002 by former PayPal entrepreneur
                and Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk with the goal of creating the technologies to reduce space transportation costs and enable the colonization of Mars. It has developed the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 launch vehicles, both designed to be reusable,
                and the Dragon spacecraft which is flown into orbit by the Falcon 9 launch vehicle to supply the International Space Station (ISS) with cargo. A manned version of Dragon is in development.</p>
            <p class="p2">SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded, liquid-propellant rocket (Falcon 1) to reach orbit, in 2008;[7] the first privately funded company to successfully launch, orbit and recover a spacecraft (Dragon), in 2010; and the
                first private company to send a spacecraft (Dragon) to the ISS, in 2012.[8] The launch of SES-8, in 2013, was the first SpaceX delivery into geosynchronous orbit, while the launch of the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), in 2015,
                was the company's first delivery beyond Earth orbit. On December 21, 2015, SpaceX successfully returned a first stage back to a landing pad near the launch site and accomplished a propulsive vertical landing, the first such accomplishment
                by a rocket on an orbital trajectory.[9] On April 8, 2016, with the launch of CRS-8, SpaceX successfully vertically landed a first stage on an ocean drone platform and delivered Dragon to Low Earth Orbit.[10] On May 6, 2016, SpaceX again
                landed a first stage, but on a geostationary transfer mission, another first.[11]</p>
            <p class="p3">NASA awarded the company a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) contract in 2006, to design and demonstrate a launch system to resupply cargo to the International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX, as of April 2016 has flown seven missions
                to the ISS under a cargo resupply contract.[12] NASA also awarded SpaceX a contract in 2011 to develop and demonstrate a human-rated Dragon as part of its Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program to transport crew to the ISS.[13]</p>

          <p class="hp1">In 2001, Musk conceptualized "Mars Oasis"; a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars, containing seeds with dehydrated gel, hydrating the gel and having plants grow on Martian soil, "so this would be the furthest that life’s ever traveled"[14] in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration and increase the Budget of NASA.[15][16][17] But Musk realized that even with a much larger space budget, travel to Mars would be prohibitively expensive and that a fundamental breakthrough in rocket technology was needed.[17] In October 2001, Musk travelled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished ICBMs (Dnepr) that could send the envisioned payloads into space.[18] The group met with companies such as Lavochkin and ISC Kosmotras. However, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers, and the group returned to the US empty-handed.[19] In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin, who had worked for the CIA’s venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel; NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and was just leaving Orbital Sciences Corporation, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group met again with Kosmotras, and were offered one rocket for US$8 million. However, this was seen by Musk as too expensive; Musk consequently stormed out of the meeting. On the flight back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed.[19] According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson,[20] Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. By applying vertical integration—principally for cost reasons;[18] around 85% of the entire Falcon/Dragon vehicle is produced in-house[21][22]— and the modular approach from software engineering (Falcon 9 uses 9 of the Merlin engines, which were tested on the single engine Falcon 1, Falcon Heavy uses three Falcon 9 booster stages), SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70 percent gross margin.[23] Another reason for vertical integration is that Musk thinks reusable rockets cannot be built with components from existing suppliers, that all the other aerospace companies are buying from as well. For example, SpaceX had to design a machine that could friction stir weld aluminium-lithium alloy for the airframe of the Falcon 9, because such a machine did not exist anywhere in the world.[24] According to Musk, SpaceX started with the smallest useful orbital rocket (Falcon 1 with about half a ton to orbit), instead of building a more complex and riskier launch vehicle, which could have failed and bankrupted the company.[25]</p>

          <p class="hp2">In early 2002, Musk was seeking staff for his new space company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached renowned rocket engineer Tom Mueller (now SpaceX's VP of Propulsion), Mueller agreed to work for Musk and SpaceX was born.[26] SpaceX was first headquartered in a 75,000 square feet warehouse in El Segundo, California. Musk decided SpaceX's first rocket would be named Falcon 1, a nod to Star Wars' Millennium Falcon. Musk planned for Falcon 1's first launch to occur in November 2003, 15 months after the company started.[19]</p>

          <p class="hp3">In January 2005, SpaceX bought a 10% stake in Surrey Satellite Technology.[27]</p>
          <p class="hp4">By March 2006, Musk had invested US$100 million of his own money into the company.[28]</p>
          <p class="hp5">On August 4, 2008, SpaceX accepted a further $20 million investment from Founders Fund.[29] In early 2012, approximately two-thirds of the company was owned by its founder[30] and his 70 million shares were then estimated to be worth $875 million on private markets,[31] which roughly valued SpaceX at $1.3 billion as of February 2012.[32] After the COTS 2+ flight in May 2012, the company private equity valuation nearly doubled to $2.4 billion.[33][34]</p>
          <p class="hp6">On 16 June 2009, SpaceX announced the opening of its Astronaut Safety and Mission Assurance Department. It hired former NASA astronaut Ken Bowersox to oversee the department as a vice president of the company.[35] However, it has since been reported that the former astronaut subsequently left SpaceX in late 2011. No reason was given and no replacement in that position has been announced.[36]</p>

          <p class="hp7">In 2010, Musk's calculations convinced him that the colonization of Mars was possible.[37]</p>
          <p class="hp8">In 2012, an initial public offering (IPO) was perceived as possible by the end of 2013,[38] but then Musk stated in June 2013 that he planned to hold off any potential IPO until after the "Mars Colonial Transporter is flying regularly,"[39] and this was reiterated in 2015 indicating that it would be many years before SpaceX would become a publicly traded company,[40][41] where Musk stated that "I just don’t want [SpaceX] to be controlled by some private equity firm that would milk it for near-term revenue"[42]</p>
          <p class="hp9">The company has grown rapidly since it was founded in 2002, growing from 160 employees in November 2005 to more than 500 by July 2008, to over 1,100 in 2010,[43][44] 1,800 in early 2012,[45] and 3,000 by early 2013.[46] The company had grown to 3,800 employees and contractors by October 2013,[47] and had "nearly 5,000" in late 2015[1] and February 2016.[2]</p>

          <p class="hp10">Achievements of SpaceX include:[48]

          The first privately funded, liquid-fueled rocket (Falcon 1) to reach orbit (28 September 2008)
          The first privately funded company to successfully launch (by Falcon 9) orbit and recover a spacecraft (Dragon) (9 December 2010)
          The first private company to send a spacecraft (Dragon) to the International Space Station (25 May 2012)
          The first private company to send a satellite into geosynchronous orbit (SES-8, 3 December 2013)
          The first landing of a first stage orbital capable rocket (Falcon 9) (22 December 2015 1:39 UTC)
          The first water landing of a first stage orbital capable rocket (Falcon 9) (8 April 2016 20:53 UTC)
          On 22 December 2015 at around 1:29 UTC SpaceX launched an upgraded Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station into low Earth orbit. After completing its primary burn, the first stage of the multistage rocket detached from the second stage as usual. The first stage then fired some of its engines to send it back to Cape Canaveral, where it achieved the world's first successful landing of a rocket that was used for an orbital launch. The landing happened at around 1:39 UTC on December 22. Stage two successfully deployed eleven communication satellites for Orbcomm.[49]

        <section class="funding">
          <h1 class="fundingTitle">Funding</h1>
          <p class="fp1">SpaceX is privately funded.[50] It developed its first launch vehicle—Falcon 1—and three rocket engines—Merlin, Kestrel, and Draco—completely with private capital. SpaceX contracted with the US government for a portion of the development funding for the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, which uses a modified version of the Merlin rocket engine.[50] SpaceX is developing the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle,[51] the Raptor methane-fueled rocket engine,[52] and a set of reusable launch vehicle technologies with private capital.[53]</p>
          <p class="fp2">As of May 2012, SpaceX had operated on total funding of approximately $1 billion in its first ten years of operation. Of this, private equity provided about $200M, with Musk investing approximately $100M and other investors having put in about $100M (Founders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, ...).[54] The remainder has come from progress payments on long-term launch contracts and development contracts. As of April 2012, NASA had put in about $400–500M of this amount, with most of that as progress payments on launch contracts.[55] By May 2012, SpaceX had contracts for 40 launch missions, and each of those contracts provide down payments at contract signing, plus many are paying progress payments as launch vehicle components are built in advance of mission launch, driven in part by US accounting rules for recognizing long-term revenue.[55]</p>
          <p class="fp3">In August 2012, SpaceX signed a large development contract with NASA to design and develop a crew-carrying space capsule for the "next generation of U.S. human spaceflight capabilities", in order to re-enable the launch of astronauts from U.S. soil by 2017. Two other companies, Boeing and Sierra Nevada Corporation, received similar development contracts. Advances made by all three companies under Space Act Agreements through NASA's Commercial Crew Integrated Capability (CCiCap) initiative are intended to ultimately lead to the availability of commercial human spaceflight services for both government and commercial customers. As part of this agreement, SpaceX was awarded a contract worth up to $440 million for contract deliverables between 2012 and May 2014.[56][57]</p>
          <p class="fp4">At year-end 2012, SpaceX had over 40 launches on its manifest representing about $4 billion in contract revenue—with many of those contracts already making progress payments to SpaceX—with both commercial and government (NASA/DOD) customers.[58] As of December 2013, SpaceX has a total of 50 future launches under contract, two-thirds of them are for commercial customers.[59][60] In late 2013, space industry media began to comment on the phenomenon that SpaceX prices are undercutting the major competitors in the commercial commsat launch market—the Ariane 5 and Proton-M[61]—at which time SpaceX had at least 10 further geostationary orbit flights on its books.[60]</p>
          <p class="fp5">In January 2015, SpaceX raised $1 billion in funding from Google and Fidelity, in exchange for 8.333% of the company, establishing the company valuation at approximately $12 billion. Google and Fidelity joined the then current investorship group of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Founders Fund, Valor Equity Partners and Capricorn.[62][63] Although the investment was thought to be related to SpaceX's launch of a satellite construction business and global satellite internet service effort,[64] Gwynne Shotwell said in March 2015 that the investment was not specifically for the global internet project.[65] Google had been searching for a satellite internet partner since the split with O3b Networks and OneWeb.[66]</p>

        <section class="goals">
          <h1 class="goalsTitle">Goals</h1>
          <p class="gp1">Musk has stated that one of his goals is to improve the cost and reliability of access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten.[67] The company plans in 2004 called for "development of a heavy lift product and even a super-heavy, if there is customer demand" with each size increase resulting in a significant decrease in cost per pound to orbit. CEO Elon Musk said: "I believe $500 per pound ($1,100/kg) or less is very achievable."[68]</p>
          <p class="gp2">SpaceX has on occasion developed new engineering development technologies to enable it to pursue its various goals. In 2015, public sources revealed that SpaceX is developing their own computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software to improve the simulation capability of evaluating rocket engine combustion design.[69]</p>
          <p class="gp3">In June 2015 the company asked the federal government for permission to begin testing for a project that aims to build a constellation of 4000 satellites capable of beaming the Internet to the entire globe, including remote regions which currently do not have internet access.[70][71]</p>
