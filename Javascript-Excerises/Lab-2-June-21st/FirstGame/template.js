/*
We are going to create a very simple game.
Things you will have to Google:
1.  Generating a random number(hint: Math.random())
2.  Running a timer (hint: setInterval, clearInterval, etc)
3.  Compare a start time and current time by seconds (hint: new Date)
The rules of the game are as follows:
Someone ate Rush's chicken pot pie!  We know it was someone in class, but we don't know who.  Luckily, Tim knows, but he's going to make you guess.
Goals of the game:

// 1.  Use the following array to represent all students:
